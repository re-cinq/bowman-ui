# bowman-ui

Presentational React components for AI chat interfaces.

`@re-cinq/bowman-ui` provides props-driven chat UI building blocks - message rendering, composer, conversation list, app shell - with no authentication, data-fetching, routing, or i18n dependencies. Consumers supply data and labels; the components render them.

The name follows the pairing the org chose: HAL Engine is the engine that thinks, Bowman is the face that talks to you.

## Install

```sh
npm install @re-cinq/bowman-ui
```

No version has been published yet; the install line above starts working with the first `v*` release.

## Requirements

- React and React DOM `^19.0.0` as peer dependencies. That range is what the components are tested against (React 19.2) - it is not a claim of React 18 support.
- Node.js `>=22` for development.

## Styles

Add two lines to your app's CSS entry:

```css
@import "@re-cinq/bowman-ui/styles.css";
@source "../node_modules/@re-cinq/bowman-ui/dist";
```

(Adjust the `@source` path so it points at the installed `dist` relative to your CSS file.)

Tailwind CSS v4 is required: the stylesheet ships only what Tailwind cannot generate from a class name - three animation keyframes (`bowman-fade-in`, `bowman-fade-dot`, `bowman-pulse-subtle`) with their utility rules, the `bowman-md-*` markdown element styling used by `markdownComponents`, and an unconditional `prefers-reduced-motion` rule. Everything else on the components - layout, color, `dark:` variants - is plain Tailwind utility class names in the built files, and your own Tailwind v4 build generates their CSS by scanning the installed `dist`. That is what the `@source` line is for: Tailwind v4 does not scan `node_modules` by default, so without it the components render unstyled. How `dark:` resolves (media query or class strategy) stays your build's decision.

`styles.css` itself is plain CSS - no Tailwind at-rules - so a non-Tailwind consumer can import it too, but must then supply the utility styles the components reference by other means.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Two TypeScript installs exist on purpose: `typescript` (~6.x) feeds the lint stack, because `typescript-eslint` caps its peer range below TypeScript 7, while the `typescript7` alias (`npm:typescript@~7.0.2`) is the actual compiler that `build` and `typecheck` invoke. Do not "clean up" the alias, and do not enable type-aware linting (`recommendedTypeChecked`) without revisiting this split — the linter would type-check with a different compiler major than the build.
