`ChatMessageList` is the container that holds a conversation: the transcript
column, the pinned auto-scroll, the empty state, and the EU AI Act
disclosure band, shipped as `src/components/ChatMessageList.tsx`
(`ChatMessageList`, `ChatMessageListProps`, `ChatMessageListHandle`,
`ChatMessageListLabels`, `defaultChatMessageListLabels`) and exported from
`src/index.ts`. It ships the transcript once, as a component, instead of
every consumer screen re-writing it inline and diverging.

## The public surface

`ChatMessageListProps` is the thirteen fields the issue names: `entries`,
`userInitials`, `labels`, `assistantAvatar`, `busy` (default `false`),
`greeting`, `prompts`, `showFeedback`, `arrowKeyFeedback`, `markdown`,
`reducedMotion`, `onCopy`, `onFeedback` - with `showFeedback`,
`arrowKeyFeedback`, `markdown`, `onCopy`, `onFeedback` and `assistantAvatar`
forwarded to every `ChatMessage` unchanged, so their defaults stay
`ChatMessage`'s own
([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L238),
[markdown](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L266),
[avatar](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L285)). Entries render in
order, keyed by `entry.id` - a reorder moves the same DOM nodes - and a
copy on the second message reports that entry's id through `onCopy`
([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L211),
[keys](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L300)). Twenty fields in
total: `specs/bowman-ui-tool-activity/spec.md` adds the four tool-entry
props `describeTool`, `showToolName`, `showToolInput` and `toolIcon`,
forwarded to every `ToolActivity` the same way,
`specs/bowman-ui-message-list-entry-footer/spec.md` adds
`renderEntryFooter`, forwarded to every `ChatMessage` as its `footer`,
`specs/bowman-ui-entry-attribution/spec.md` adds `attribution`, the
persona-id lookup table that overrides `assistantAvatar` and supplies
`assistantName` per entry, and `specs/bowman-ui-thinking-trace/spec.md`
adds `showThinking`, the flag that gates whether a thinking entry mounts a
`ThinkingTrace` at all.

`ChatMessageListLabels` extends `ChatMessageLabels`, `ThinkingIndicatorLabels`
and, since `specs/bowman-ui-tool-activity/spec.md`, `ToolActivityLabels` -
the flat composite of docs/design-notes.md § Labels decision 3 - plus `aiDisclosure`
(required, no default) and `transcript` (the scroll region's accessible
name, default `"Conversation"`). `ChatMessageLabels` and
`ThinkingIndicatorLabels` both declare `thinking: string`; the keys collide
legally because they name the same concept with the same type, which is
exactly decision 3's "unique by concept" rule - a future function-form
`thinking` on either side breaks the `extends` and must rename by concept.
`ToolActivityLabels`'s three keys (`activity`, `activityDone`, `details`)
and `ThinkingTraceLabels`'s `thinkingTrace`
(`specs/bowman-ui-thinking-trace/spec.md`) add no further collision, and
`assistantMessageFrom` (`specs/bowman-ui-entry-attribution/spec.md`) rides
in through `ChatMessageLabels`. The union is therefore eighteen keys,
seventeen in `defaultChatMessageListLabels`
([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L197)).

Because `aiDisclosure` has no default, `ChatMessageList` is the package's
first component whose `labels` prop is itself **required**:
`labels: Partial<ChatMessageListLabels> & Required<Pick<ChatMessageListLabels, "aiDisclosure">>`.
docs/design-notes.md § Labels records the exception. Omitting `aiDisclosure` is a
compile error, pinned from outside by an `@ts-expect-error` fixture, and the
defaults object cannot satisfy `Readonly<Required<ChatMessageListLabels>>`
([validated by](../../tests/types/chat-message-list-type-assertions.tsx#L90),
[no-default](../../tests/types/chat-message-list-type-assertions.tsx#L53),
compiled by
[chat-message-list-dist](../../tests/chat-message-list-dist.test.ts#L87)).
Passing only `aiDisclosure` resolves every other label to its English
default ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L190)).

## The decisions

1. **The AI disclosure is a band above the scroll region, unremovable.**
   The EU AI Act obliges telling users they are talking to an AI, and the
   obligation applies regardless of server location because the agent
   serves EU users. The component ships no default sentence, so no
   unreviewed English placeholder can stand in - the required label is the
   enforcement. The band renders outside the scroll region (it cannot
   scroll away) and above it (visible before the customer types), in both
   states, and no prop in `ChatMessageListProps` removes it - pinned by a
   render with every optional prop `false` or `undefined`. The type
   enforces presence, not substance: an empty string renders an empty
   band, and per docs/design-notes.md § Labels decision 5 the package adds
   no runtime guard - a consumer that supplies `""` owns that compliance
   failure ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L150),
   [L167](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L167)).
2. **Auto-scroll follows the bottom only while the reader is pinned.**
   Pinning is tracked on the region's `scroll` event as
   `scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight <= 32`; scrolling away opts out
   until a scroll event returns the reader to the bottom, and the 32px
   threshold is pinned at both sides of the boundary. One exception keeps
   the feature alive in real browsers: a smooth animation this component
   started fires downward scroll events of its own, and those do not
   unpin - reaching the bottom, or any upward reader-initiated movement,
   settles the flight. Mount always scrolls to the latest message
   unconditionally, instant, before any scroll event
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L714),
   [L630](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L630),
   [L648](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L648),
   [append while pinned](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L613),
   [L757](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L757),
   [L784](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L784)).
3. **Smooth on append, instant on delta, always instant under reduced
   motion.** `behavior: "smooth"` when `entries.length` grew, `"auto"` when
   only content changed, and `useReducedMotion(reducedMotion)` (021's hook)
   forces `"auto"` always. A delta must arrive as a **new `entries`
   array**: the scroll effect keys on the prop's identity, so a reducer
   that mutates in place never scrolls - the shape every React state update
   produces anyway - and the inverse holds too: a parent that rebuilds the
   array on every render issues a visually-silent instant scroll per render
   while pinned. `busy` turning on while pinned also scrolls (instant), so
   the ThinkingIndicator cannot appear below the fold
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L725),
   [L668](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L668),
   [L688](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L688)).
4. **`scrollTo` with a `scrollTop` fallback, never `scrollIntoView`.**
   `scrollIntoView` walks to the nearest scrollable ancestor outside this
   package's control. The fallback (`node.scrollTop = node.scrollHeight`
   when `scrollTo` is not a function) exists because jsdom performs no
   layout and implements neither method - which is also why the test
   geometry (`scrollHeight`, `clientHeight`) and the `scrollTo` spy are
   stubs installed by the tests
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L741)).
5. **The handle is the consumer's escape hatch.**
   `scrollToBottom()` scrolls even while unpinned and re-pins, so the next
   change follows again - the primitive for a consumer's own "jump to
   latest" control - and respects reduced motion. `isPinnedToBottom()`
   measures the live geometry rather than replaying the last scroll
   event - which means it reports the truth at call time and can disagree
   with the event-tracked gate until the next scroll event (a resize or
   zoom moves geometry without firing one); the predicate describes the
   region, not the component's next scheduling decision. A handle retained
   past unmount is a no-op, not a crash
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L899),
   [L846](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L846),
   [L878](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L878),
   [L824](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L824)).
6. **The transcript is `role="log"` with `aria-live="off"`.** The role's
   implicit `aria-live="polite"` would have a screen reader announce every
   streamed token; the resolved `transcript` label is the region's
   accessible name. `ThinkingIndicator`'s own `role="status"` subtree is
   the one announcement worth making, and it now carries an **explicit**
   `aria-live="polite"` (a one-attribute amendment to
   `src/components/ThinkingIndicator.tsx`, the ARIA-canonical spelling of
   the role's implicit value) so the override is queryable as an attribute:
   `[aria-live="polite"]` inside the region matches exactly when `busy` is
   true. Nothing announces that a streamed answer has finished; that needs
   a real assistive-technology check and is tracked as a Phase 3 task, not
   here ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L919),
   [L934](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L934),
   [pinned in its own suite](../../tests/ThinkingIndicator.test.tsx#L153)).
7. **The scroll region always renders; the empty state replaces the
   transcript column inside it.** With `entries.length === 0 && !busy` the
   centred `greeting` and `prompts` slots render in place of the message
   column and no `ChatMessage` mounts; with entries, the slots never
   render. An empty transcript with `busy` shows the indicator, not the
   slots. The library computes neither slot: a greeting typically reads the
   clock and the signed-in identity during render, and a prompt catalogue
   is product-specific - both belong to the consumer
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L101),
   [L117](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L117),
   [L133](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L133)).
8. **`busy` renders exactly one `ThinkingIndicator`, after the last
   entry**, forwarding `assistantAvatar` and the `thinking`/`thinkingRegion`
   slices; `busy` false renders none. When to set `busy` is data-layer
   state the consumer computes
   ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L438),
   [L454](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L454),
   [L460](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L460)).
9. **The container does not own the composer.** A `composer` slot was
   considered and rejected: it would make this a two-deliverable
   `ChatPanel` and hand the library a layout decision the consumer can make
   with two elements. `ChatComposer` (027) stays a sibling.

## Layout

The root is `flex min-h-0 flex-1 flex-col` and the region
`overflow-y-auto` with a `max-w-3xl` column at `gap-6` rhythm. Without
`min-h-0` a flex child never shrinks and the region never scrolls, so the
parent must be a bounded flex column - recorded as docs/design-notes.md's
`## Layout` section, the note every consumer reads before mounting the
list.

## Mechanical invariants

- No `@clerk`, `swr`, `next-intl`, `next/`, `@/` or
  `lucide-react` import, and every relative import ends in `.js`
  ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L955)).
- **GDPR.** The rendered entries are customer questions carrying booking
  identifiers and names. The component references no `console.`,
  `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `fetch`, `sendBeacon` - nor
  `scrollIntoView`; the suite-wide console and network traps in
  `tests/setup.ts` hold every test of this component to zero calls
  ([validated by](../../tests/ChatMessageList.test.tsx#L965)).
- `dist/components/ChatMessageList.js` opens with `"use client";` as its
  first statement per 018 decision 1, and ships with its `.d.ts` in the
  pack ([validated by](../../tests/chat-message-list-dist.test.ts#L66),
  [pack](../../tests/chat-message-list-dist.test.ts#L72)).
- `ChatMessageList` sits in the `labelsProp` partition bucket with a
  sentinel harness that renders a user entry, a thinking entry with
  `showThinking` on, a linked assistant entry and the busy indicator, then
  clicks copy and thumbs-up so the interaction-only labels reach the
  checked DOM. Its key-coverage check is the package's one asymmetric
  sentinel test - defaults keys **plus** `aiDisclosure` - because the
  required label is deliberately absent from `defaultChatMessageListLabels`
  ([validated by](../../tests/labelled-exports.test.tsx#L557),
  [L365](../../tests/labelled-exports.test.tsx#L365)).

## Recorded decisions

- **Name.** `ChatMessageList`, not `MessageList`: the longer name states
  what the list holds and stays clear of the generic `MessageList` name a
  consumer app is likely to declare itself.
- **Labels forwarding.** The resolved eighteen-key object is handed to
  `ChatMessage` whole - structurally a valid `Partial<ChatMessageLabels>`
  whose seven extra keys ride along harmlessly through `ChatMessage`'s own
  `resolveLabels` merge, decision 3's flat-union forwarding without an
  eleven-key copy - while `ThinkingIndicator`, `ThinkingTrace` and
  `ToolActivity` each receive their own keys explicitly.
- **Not in scope**, per the issue: a jump-to-latest button, an
  unread-count badge, scroll-position restore, a per-entry `footer` slot
  (reopened by 133's `renderEntryFooter`,
  `specs/bowman-ui-message-list-entry-footer`), the load-error/retry block,
  virtualisation, and every Danish string - the
  greeting, the prompts and the `aiDisclosure` sentence belong to
  `support-agent`'s catalogue. Rendering `ToolChatEntry` is now in scope,
  shipped via `ToolActivity` (`specs/bowman-ui-tool-activity/spec.md`), as
  is per-entry persona chrome, shipped via `attribution`
  (`specs/bowman-ui-entry-attribution/spec.md`), as is rendering
  `ThinkingChatEntry` behind `showThinking`, shipped via `ThinkingTrace`
  (`specs/bowman-ui-thinking-trace/spec.md`).
